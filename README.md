# 👋 Hello, I’m a Developer and Network Student focused on building a strong foundation in Programming, Systems, and Networking Fundamentals

I am restarting my GitHub from scratch.  
2025 will be my year of complete reconstruction through **practical, progressive, and well-documented projects**.

This profile will show my real learning journey and hands-on evolution.
